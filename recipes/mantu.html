    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        Mantu is a beloved Afghan dish that encapsulates the rich 
        culinary heritage of Afghanistan. These delectable dumplings 
        are typically stuffed with a savory mixture of spiced ground 
        meat, often beef or lamb, and aromatic onions. The dumplings 
        are then carefully folded into delicate pockets and steamed to 
        perfection. Served atop a bed of yogurt and garnished with a 
        tantalizing tomato-based sauce, along with a sprinkle of dried 
        mint, Mantu is a flavorful masterpiece. Its delightful blend of 
        textures and flavors, coupled with its cultural significance, 
        makes Mantu a true Afghan delicacy, enjoyed with family and 
        friends during special occasions and gatherings.
